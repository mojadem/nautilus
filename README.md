# Nautilus
Nautilus is a Virtual Reality experience that takes the player through a storyline with themes of aging, friendship, forgiveness, and reconciliation. The player goes through the experience as the Main Character (MC) of the storyline, who moved away from their two best friends Casey and Pat during young adulthood. Throughout Nautilus, the player or MC must go through a series of memories and environments that address the death of their close friend Pat, and address their tense relationship with Casey.

Nautilus was a collaborative project created in DART 301: Collaboration Studio at Penn State University.
